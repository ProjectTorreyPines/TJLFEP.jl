# DIII-D benchmark: cost vs N_BASIS (`202017C42_500ms_v3.1`, SCAN_N=20)

This is the timing/accuracy benchmark for the **DIII-D** `202017C42_500ms_v3.1`
case — the small, single-thermal-ion verification case used for the bit-for-bit
Fortran match. It is kept here for reference; the main
[`README.md`](../README.md#benchmark-cost-vs-n_basis-ucp-scan_n20) uses the larger,
**reactor-relevant UCP_complete** case for its headline numbers, because the GPU
payoff scales with the eigenmatrix size (species × `N_BASIS`) and the DIII-D case
is too small to show it: against a *fully MPI-parallel* Fortran (`-n 1280`) the
DIII-D GPU advantage is only ~1.6–2.8× at `N_BASIS=32` (and Fortran wins outright
at `N_BASIS ≤ 16`), whereas UCP reaches ~4–8× at `N_BASIS=32`.

20-radius scan on Perlmutter, all with sysimages. **Cost is reported in node-hours**
(nodes × wallclock), the fair, layout-independent metric (Fortran runs on 10 CPU
nodes, the GPU tiers on 5). Each solver runs on its fastest parallel layout
(**rule of thumb: `grid` → MPS team, `ad` → in-process threads**; an MPS team only
adds overhead to `ad`, see below).

The solvers, with node-hours vs the fully MPI-parallel Fortran (`-n 1280`) at `N_BASIS=32`:

| Solver | vs Fortran | What it computes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| **`:ad :only`** | **~2.8×** | Approximates `:grid`: a smooth, de-quantized version of the `w≥1` result (median `:only/grid ≈ 0.9`). Fast iteration only; misses the `w<1` edge modes. |
| **`:grid`** | **~1.6×** | The verified Fortran-equivalent `(kyhat × width × factor)` sweep (thousands of eigensolves/radius). |
| **`:ad :wide`** | **~1.1×** | Adds the narrow `w<1` AE modes in one log-seeded pass; conservative (within ~1–2× of `:ad :locate`, never below it). Bulk NN-DB generation. |
| **`:ad :locate`** *(default)* | **~0.55×** | Adds the narrow `w<1` AE modes; the faithful narrow-width value (~1.8× the Fortran cost, buying the `w<1` accuracy). Production. |

The `ad` solvers are **grid-independent**: rather than reading `sfmin` off the coarse
factor grid, they locate the instability onset directly (Newton root-find with exact
forward-mode AD derivatives). `:grid`/`:ad :only` stay in the Fortran `w≥1` box;
`:ad :locate`/`:ad :wide` additionally resolve the narrow-width (`w<1`)
EP-driven modes it excludes (the *entire* `sfmin` reduction below grid, up to ~12× at
the edge). Higher-fidelity internal reference tiers (`robust_ad`, and the
`nbasis`-converged `truth`) sit above `:ad :locate`, which matches them essentially
bit-for-bit; they are documented for reference in
[`docs/AD_SOLVERS_AND_SEARCH_BOUNDS.md`](https://github.com/ProjectTorreyPines/TJLFEP.jl/blob/master/docs/AD_SOLVERS_AND_SEARCH_BOUNDS.md).

**Accuracy**: `sfmin(IR)` for all solvers at `N_BASIS=32`:

`:ad :locate` (green) drops well below `grid` (grey, which reproduces the blue Fortran
reference bit-for-bit) and `:ad :only` (orange) into the narrow-width modes at the outer
radii (IR ≳ 65; up to ~12× below grid). `:ad :wide` (dark red) recovers nearly all of that
in a single pass, within ~1–2× of `:ad :locate` (a mild, conservative over-prediction,
e.g. ~1.7× at IR=64) and never below it. Colors and legend order match the node-hours
plot below for quick cross-reference.

Absolute node-hours at `N_BASIS=32`, each solver on its fastest layout (Fortran
`-n 1280` on 10 CPU nodes; `grid`/`:ad :only` on 5 MPS GPU nodes; `:ad
:locate`/`:ad :wide` on a 1-node backfill with 4 GPU workers draining a 20-radius
queue): Fortran ≈0.51; `grid` ≈0.31, `:ad :only` ≈0.18, `:ad :wide` ≈0.46,
`:ad :locate` ≈0.92. So `grid`/`:ad :only` land below the fully-parallel Fortran
(~1.6×/~2.8×), `:ad :wide` is near parity (~1.1×), and `:ad :locate` sits above it
(~1.8× the Fortran cost) — the price of the `w<1` accuracy. `:ad :wide` is ~2×
cheaper than `:locate` (the gap widens at higher `N_BASIS`, where the faithful
confirm costs more). The per-backend tables below give the raw wallclock seconds.

**Best-throughput layout depends on the solver** (for these `SCAN_N=20` runs):
- **`:grid` and `:ad :only` → 5 GPU nodes.** Per-radius cost is uniform, so
  spreading the 20 radii across 5 nodes (~4 radii/node) minimizes wallclock with
  no wasted node-hours.
- **`:ad :locate` and `:ad :wide` → 1 GPU node, backfill.** Their edge radii take
  much longer (the narrow-width `w<1` locate is triggered there), so a fixed
  multi-node split would leave nodes idle waiting on the straggler edge radii.
  Running a single node with 4 workers draining a shared 20-radius claim queue
  keeps every GPU busy and gives the lowest node-hours.

**Grid solver**: Fortran CPU (10 nodes, `-n 1280` = 128 ranks/node) vs Julia CPU
(10 nodes, SlurmClusterManager) vs Julia GPU (5 A100 nodes, **MPS team**):

| N_BASIS | Fortran CPU (s) | Julia CPU (s) | Julia GPU MPS (s) | GPU speedup vs Fortran (wallclock) |
|--------:|----------------:|--------------:|------------------:|-----------------------------------:|
| 6  | 17.1  | 141.3   | 140.4 | 0.12× |
| 8  | 19.7  | 148.4   | 149.0 | 0.13× |
| 16 | 33.5  | 250.0   | 161.7 | 0.21× |
| 32 | 182.8 | 1029.2  | 226.3 | 0.81× |

(Wallclock here compares a **5-node** GPU run to a **10-node** `-n 1280` Fortran
run — twice the nodes — so raw wallclock favors Fortran. The fair,
node-count-normalized comparison is node-hours: at `N_BASIS=32` the GPU `:grid`
tier is ~1.6× cheaper than Fortran, see the node-hours plot/section above.)

**`:ad :only` (bare `w≥1` AD, no faithful confirm)**: Julia GPU (5 A100 nodes,
**in-process threads**), vs the grid GPU path (both 5-node, so this wallclock ratio is
apples-to-apples):

| N_BASIS | Grid GPU MPS (s) | `:ad :only` GPU threads (s) | `:only` vs grid-GPU (wallclock) |
|--------:|-----------------:|----------------------------:|--------------------------------:|
| 6  | 140.4 | 69.3  | 2.0× |
| 8  | 149.0 | 64.0  | 2.3× |
| 16 | 161.7 | 79.9  | 2.0× |
| 32 | 226.3 | 132.2 | **1.7×** |

The `:only` path is ~1.7–2.3× faster than the grid MPS path in wallclock; the
advantage narrows toward high `N_BASIS` (to ~1.7× at `N_BASIS=32`) because
`:ad :only`'s wallclock grows faster with `N_BASIS` than the grid MPS path's. Note this
is the *same* `ad` solver run two ways: on an **MPS team** instead of threads it is
*slower* (≈4.5 min at `N_BASIS=32`, worsening with `N_BASIS`): the per-radius AD regions
are small and the descent is sequential, so team-spawn/remote-call overhead never
amortizes. **Rule of thumb: `grid` → MPS, `ad` → threads.**

The `nbasis`-converged `truth` reference tier (validation only, ~34 min for the full
profile at `N_BASIS=32`) is documented in
[`docs/AD_SOLVERS_AND_SEARCH_BOUNDS.md`](https://github.com/ProjectTorreyPines/TJLFEP.jl/blob/master/docs/AD_SOLVERS_AND_SEARCH_BOUNDS.md).

Data: `docs/plots/scan20_timing.csv`. Reproduce: grid sweep with
`dev/timing/submit_timing_vs_nbasis.sh`, AD sweep with
`dev/timing/submit_timing_vs_nbasis_ad.sh` (capability 4).
