# Build the GENERIC GPU sysimage: CUDA + TJLF + TJLFEP (+ the TJLFEPIMASExt IMAS extension)
# + the FUSE/IMAS stack, with the GPU eigensolve path precompiled. Works for both the
# file-based scan (run_gacode_scan_task) and the IMAS/FUSE actor path on GPU. Because FUSE/IMAS
# are baked, the image still loads fast (the FUSE cost is compilation, which the image removes).
#
# Builds against the registry-resolved "full" environment created by setup_registry_env.jl
# (TJLFEP_BUILD_ENV): every package at its released FuseRegistry version, so any user can
# reproduce the image — no maintainer dev tree involved. FUSE and the weak-dep trio are
# direct deps of that project, which is what lets create_sysimage bake them; listing
# IMAS/GACODE/TurbulentTransport makes Julia load them during the build, baking the
# TJLFEPIMASExt extension (the dd/FUSE actor entry points) into the image automatically.
