# Build the full CPU sysimage: TJLF + TJLFEP (file-only), with the CPU eigensolve path
# precompiled via precompile_cpu_workload.jl. This bakes in the per-radius JIT that cold
# distributed CPU workers otherwise pay on every spawn. The FUSE/IMAS stack is excluded by
# construction: the lean build project never resolves the IMAS/GACODE/TurbulentTransport
# weak deps, so TJLFEPIMASExt stays dormant. (CUDA is a hard TJLFEP dep and rides along in
# the manifest, but degrades gracefully on CPU nodes.)
#
# Builds against the registry-resolved "lean" environment created by setup_registry_env.jl
# (TJLFEP_BUILD_ENV): released FuseRegistry versions only, reproducible by any user.
# Run on a CPU node.
